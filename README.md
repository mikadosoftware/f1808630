# Simple Instructions

Please download using `git clone https://github.com/mikadosoftware/f1808630`
Then run:

```
$ cd f1808630
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

This will start the app in development mode, and should bring up your browser 
on http://localhost:3000

The app will immediately try to download the Flag API, please wait a few
seconds, and it will then display the world flags and countries in a grid with
simple instructions.

Click on any row on the table, and it will store the row details in local
storage. There is a CSS-modified button that allows you to view the storage
choice.

You can search using the search box at the top of the page - I suggest using
`can` for a number of countries with `can` in there - not just Canada!
